The [b][url=http://maml.org/]Massachusetts Math Olympiad[/url][/b] is a competition open to all math team members. The first round is a multiple choice exam taken during school in October, and high scorers are invited to the second round, a proof contest taken at the beginning of March.

The [b][url=http://www.wpi.edu/News/Events/MathMeet/]WPI Math Meet[/url][/b] is an annual competition sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences department at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in October. 4 team members are invited to participate.

The [b][url=/LMT/About]Lexington Mathematics Tournament[/url][/b] is the annual competition for middle school students hosted by the LHS Math Team. Throughout the year we accept original problem submissions and also seek volunteers to help organize different parts of the competition.

[subheading]National Competitions[/subheading]
The [b][url=http://www.themathleague.com/]New England Math League[/url][/b] is our local division of the Math League contests. It is open to all math team members and happens once a month, October through March, in room 800 after school from about 2:40 to 3:10. It is a 6-problem exam.

The [b][url=http://web.mandelbrot.org/]Mandelbrot Competition[/url][/b] is a national competition held on Fridays after school once a month, November through March. It is open to all math team members. There are two levels of competition: regional and national, the latter being for more experienced problem solvers. Both tests have 7 problems and last 40 minutes.

The [b][url=http://amc.maa.org/]American Mathematics Competitions[/url][/b] are a set of national competitions sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America. The first competitions in the series are the AMC 10, open to all students in 10th grade or below, and the AMC 12, open to all students, which happen in February. There are two separate testing dates - one can only take one test per testing date, but students in 10th grade or below make opt to take the AMC 10 on one date and the AMC 12 on the other. High scorers are invited to participate in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) in March, and high scorers on the AIME are invited to the USA Mathematical Olympiad and USA Junior Mathematical Olympiad in April.

The [b][url=http://web.mit.edu/hmmt/www/]Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament[/url][/b] is an international math competition organized by undergraduates from Harvard and MIT, held at one of the two campuses each year in February. 24 students, in teams of 8, are invited to participate. The [b][url=http://web.mit.edu/hmmt/www/november.shtml]Harvard-MIT November Tournament[/url][/b] is a similar competition geared toward local schools and less-experienced problem solvers, held in November. All math team members are invited to participate, but must try out to be placed on a team of 4 to 6 students.

The [b][url=http://arml.com/]American Regions Math League[/url][/b] is a national competition held at four college campuses around the country in June. Eastern Massachusetts fields 3 teams of 15 students each, chosen by tryout, and competes at Pennsylvania State University.
