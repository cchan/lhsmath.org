  <h1>Webmaster Guide</h1>
  
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Welcome! If you're reading this, you must be the new webmaster for the Lexington High School
  Math Club. Before doing anything else, read to all of the below, print or save-as-file a copy of this page, and 
  keep that copy somewhere secure - a lot of this is pretty sensitive information, but you will need this info 
  if you lose access to or have problems with the site.
  After that, take a look around the Admin portion of the site.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
	<li><span class="b">Back up the website at least monthly.</span> To do this, log
	in and go to the &quot;Database&quot; page. Click <span class="i">Generate Backup</span>,
	then <span class="i">Download All Content</span>. Save upload the ZIP file to the Webmasters' Dropbox 
	(which should have been shared with you when you became webmaster). You may delete old database backups 
	from the website (at the bottom of &quot;Files&quot;), but keep all those ZIP files around for a year. 
	Beyond that, please	retain all year-end backups (the last ones, taken in June).<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li><span class="b">Help out the Captains.</span> The controls on this site are mostly self-explanatory.
	If a captain needs help with something, you can hopefully figure it out.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li><span class="b">Help out users.</span> The webmaster email address is listed in a lot of places 
	on the website. If people have website problems, they'll contact you.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li><span class="b">Graduating Alumni.</span> After the end-of-year ceremony, go to "Alumni" and
	click the button. Then back up the site.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li><span class="b">New Captains/Club Advisors.</span> You are responsible for graduating old captains/advisors and
	elevating new ones. Please notify captains/advisors that their contact information is visible to all
	members, remind them to keep members' email addresses strictly confidential, and set up a mail forwarder
	for them. To do this, log in to Gmail as webmaster@lhsmath.org and edit the mail filters.
	<ul>
		<li>All Captains: <span class="monospace">(name)@lhsmath.org</span>, <span class="monospace">captains@lhsmath.org</span>.</li>
		<li>Some captain (doesn't matter who): <span class="monospace">contact@lhsmath.org</span>, 
			<span class="monospace">lmt@lhsmath.org</span><li>
		<li>Advisor(s): <span class="monospace">(name)@lhsmath.org</span>, <span class="monospace">advisor@lhsmath.org</span>.</li>
		<li>Webmaster(s): <span class="monospace">(name)@lhsmath.org</span>, <span class="monospace">webmaster@lhsmath.org</span>, 
			<span class="monospace">mailbot@lhsmath.org</span>, and perhaps others if you wish.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><span class="b">Renewing Payment.</span> You should receive an email alert when the website is
	running low on funds. To load more, log in to the 
	<a href="https://members.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.NET control panel</a> and refill the
	account with money via PayPal or other methods (talk to the club advisor about getting money). 
	Please be aware that you will also need to renew the domain name periodically. The site draws between 
	$25 and $35 a year, including domain registration costs.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li><span class="b">Picking a Successor.</span> When you are in your Senior year, choose someone to be the next admin. 
	They should start to take over and learn their way around the site. Share the Webmasters' Dropbox with them, 
	change the mail forwarders so that they receive webmaster emails, and make sure everything on this page makes sense.<br /><br /></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Dealing with Abuse</h3>
  <p>The site has several features built in to deal with abuse. IP addresses are blocked for 10 minutes
  after 10 incorrect login attempts (per email address). This control is designed to prevent guessing
  while not allowing the school's entire subnet to be locked out at once. You can check the number of
  failed logins per IP and account in &quot;Login Log.&quot; More information is logged to the database
  table <span class="monospace">login_attempts</span>. Banned users are also logged. To block an IP address
  from accessing the site entirely, edit the Config file (see next section).</p>
  
  <h3>Recovering Admin Access</h3>
  <p>If all Admins lose access to the site, you can use the Super-Admin account to restore your account.
  To activate this feature, you will need to edit the Config file. First, log in to the server
  via SFTP (See "Developing the Website"). Then, navigate to
  <span class="monospace">/home/public/.lib</span> and edit the file <span class="monospace">CONFIG.php</span>.
  Find the section titled <span class="i">Super-Admin Feature</span> and follow the directions. Your
  User ID is below. Make sure to disable Super-Admin when you're done!</p>
  <p>Your User ID is: <span class="b"><?=$_SESSION['user_id']?></span>.</p>
  
  <h3>Keep in mind...</h3>
  <p>Please follow these guidelines when managing the site:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Guard the password & accounts file very carefully. Share it with as few people as possible.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li>Respect users' privacy. Never give out anyone's personal information. Don't look at test scores
	unless you have to. Information not accessible to all members should be treated as strictly
	confidential. Also, do your best to prevent the Captains from spamming everyone.<br /><br /></li>
	
	<li>You can play around with the site as long as you take responsibility when you break stuff,
	but <span class="i">please</span>, don't use Math Club hosting to run your own websites or anything.
	Remember, the club advisor is ultimately responsible for all content on this site.<br /><br /></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>LMT</h3>
  <p>Running the LMT is considerably more involved. The best way to do this is probably to be trained by the last
  Tech Czar. Knowing PHP is a must (just for the Guts round - ask a predecessor for help (nicely) if necessary)
  me to). Edit <span class="monospace">.lib/lmt-scoring.php</span>, and mind the preconditions and posconditions!
  Content on the public part of the LMT website is updated through the web interface (in database rather than files). 
  Please write in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">valid XHTML 1.0</a> for those pages!</p>
  
  <h3>Developing the Website</h3>
  <p>If you would like to improve upon the Math Club website, awesome!</p>
  <ul>
	<li>We use Git on BitBucket (because private repositories) for source control. Before editing anything you must get 
		<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> command line, or 
		<a href="https://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> beginner UI. 
		Demand some Git help from the previous webmaster if you don't already know it.</li>
	<li>Text editor. <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or 
		<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> work excellently. Avoid Vim or Emacs :).</li>
	<li>Local test server. Probably the easiest and most flexible way is to download 
		<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a>. Use <span class="monospace">.lib/CONFIG.local.php</span> 
		to override configuration values for local testing (don't upload this). Never test code on the real lhsmath.org server. 
		To set this up properly you'll also have to go to LHSMATH PHPMyAdmin and export the database, and import it into your 
		XAMPP's PHPMyAdmin. Be careful of what you do - sending mail <i>still actually works</i>! (you can, of course, abuse your local 
		data however you like as long as it's not uploaded back up.)</li>
	<li>Editing the production copy via SFTP. Try <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> or 
		<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. Don't upload the <span class="monospace">.git</span> directory.</li>
	<li>A lot of secret and important stuff is on the Dropbox. Ask your predecessor if they haven't 
		already shared it with you. Most of the accounts are fairly self-explanatory.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Code</h3>
  <ul>
	<li>Examine the code see how the site works - a good starting point is 
	<span class="monospace">Account/Register.php</span>. Note the code at the top - just about every page 
	starts like this. Honestly, the best way to get familiar with the site is through reading the code directly.</li>
	<li>It's a pretty big codebase, and it's pretty complex. You're encouraged to try to improve it 
	and reduce it, as long as you don't break it. You can check the list of Issues on BitBucket to see if 
	the previous webmaster left any known problems unsolved. Though we tried our best to make the code readable 
	and neat, it can be hard to decipher at times, so feel free to ask what particular things do if you just
	can't figure it out yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Debugging Tips</h3>
  <p>Things break often when you're changing things up. Here's a few tips to help you on your way.</p>
debug_print_backtrace(), register_shutdown_function(), set_error_handler() -- put these in various locations and move it around to locate the problem
Google, PHP.net, StackOverflow, past webmasters
Looking for cautionary comments [e.g. "I hate mail config $#%^$%#"]
If it's crashing on the website but working on your computer, check that CONFIG.local.php isn't uploaded.
